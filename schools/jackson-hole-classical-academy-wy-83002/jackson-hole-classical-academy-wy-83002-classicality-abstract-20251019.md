**Expanded Abstract — Jackson Hole Classical Academy (Six Criteria + Ratings)**

**1) Religious & Metaphysical Foundations — RATING: CLASSICAL**
Grounds learning in Christian theism and transcendental moral realism; emphasizes virtue and the pursuit of truth, goodness, and beauty, with language of wonder and ordered loves. No values-neutral/relativist framing observed.

**2) Purpose & Goal — RATING: CLASSICAL**
Mission and aims prioritize formation—cultivating wisdom and virtue in heart and mind—over vocational credentialing or skills-first outcomes; T-G-B language is explicit and repeated.

**3) Curriculum — RATING: CLASSICAL**
Curriculum is organized by the liberal arts (Trivium), with Latin, primary texts/Great Books, history taught as history (not “social studies”), and robust fine arts; occasional “hands-on/inquiry” phrasing appears but does not displace the liberal-arts core.

**4) Pedagogy — RATING: CLASSICAL**
Lower school practices memory work, chanting/recitation, narration, and cultivation of wonder; upper school uses Socratic discussion, seminars, formal writing, and rhetoric/speeches—forming a coherent K–12 pedagogy aligned to classical ends.

**5) Faculty — RATING: CLASSICAL**
Teachers are framed as mentors and exemplars—“living curriculum”—with explicit expectations for moral and intellectual virtue, collegiality, and love of the true, good, and beautiful.

**6) Parents & Community — RATING: CLASSICAL**
Parents are identified as primary educators; the school positions itself as a partner and invites ongoing family participation through rhythms and communications supportive of home–school alignment.

**Aggregate Verdict: CLASSICAL**
Consistent, explicit alignment across all six elements; minor experiential/inquiry references are present but peripheral and do not undermine the classical center.
