Here’s a full classicality audit of **Jackson Hole Classical Academy (JHCA)**, using the “Six Essential Elements” keyword framework and the school’s public materials.

# Aggregate verdict: **CLASSICAL**

JHCA consistently signals the core marks of classical Christian education—**wisdom & virtue formation**, **truth–goodness–beauty**, **Trivium/Liberal Arts**, **Socratic pedagogy & memory work**, **teacher-as-mentor**, and **parent partnership**—with minimal presence of negative indicators.

---

# 1) Religious & Metaphysical Foundations → **CLASSICAL**

**School’s own words (samples):**

- “cultivate… **wisdom and virtue**… fulfill their **God-given** potential… contribute to a **flourishing** and free society.” ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][1])
- “pursuit of **truth** begins with **wonder**… love what is **true, good, and beautiful**… within the **historic Christian** tradition that calls each person to **love God** and man.” ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][1])
- “As a private school in the **classical and Christian** traditions, we believe that a **Creator** has ordered the world…” ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][2])
- “**Theological** virtues of faith, hope, and love… **cardinal** virtues…” ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][3])

**Keyword check vs. framework** (positive/negative lists): truth, goodness, beauty; virtue; wisdom; Creator; Christian; love God; wonder; theological virtues; cardinal virtues → **positive indicators** for transcendental moral realism, theological grounding, formation of affections.

**Tally:** 12 positive vs 0 negative → **100% positive**
**Notes:** Explicit Christian theism and virtue language are strong; no “values-neutral/relativism” language surfaced (negative list).

---

# 2) School Purpose & Goal → **CLASSICAL**

**School’s own words:**

- Mission centered on **wisdom and virtue**; **truth, good, and beautiful**; **formation** of heart and mind. ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][1])
- “Educating the **heart and mind** includes fostering habits… for a **virtuous** life.” ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][1])
- “focus our teaching on the **heart and mind**… emphasizing what is **true, good and beautiful**.” ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][4])

**Keyword check vs. framework:** cultivation of wisdom/virtue; pursuit of T-G-B; **formation not information** → all positive purpose markers.

**Tally:** 9 positive vs 0 negative → **100% positive**
**Notes:** No heavy job-prep/skills-first emphasis (a common negative).

---

# 3) Curriculum → **CLASSICAL**

**School’s own words:**

- “Overview… follows the classical paradigm of **grammar, logic, and rhetoric** (**The Trivium**).” ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][5])
- **Latin** from early grades; **poetry memorization**; integrated **fine arts**; **history** described as narrative (not “social studies”). ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][6])
- Students “read and discuss the **literary and philosophical classics**… the **great works**… that have shaped… history.” ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][2])
- Upper School literature: **close reading**, **Socratic discussions**, essay writing; tie-ins to **primary sources** in history. ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][7])

**Keyword check vs. framework:** explicit **Trivium**, **Great Books/classics**, **Latin**, history taught as **history**, **wonder** → strong positives across Seven Liberal Arts & Great Books; integration & wonder present.

**Negatives present?** Minor references to “inquiry-based learning” and “hands-on” (lower school science), but not as the organizing paradigm (i.e., not displacing Great Books/Trivium). ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][6]) These phrases are part of the negative list only when central/dominant.

**Tally:** 10 positive vs 2 potential-negative terms → **83% positive**
**Score rationale:** Trivium/Latin/Great Books language is explicit and repeated; light experiential phrasing does not outweigh classical structure.

---

# 4) Pedagogy (Teaching Methods) → **CLASSICAL**

**School’s own words:**

- Teachers use the **Socratic method** to sharpen reasoning. ([Jackson Hole Classical Academy][8])
- Grammar stage: joy in **repeating/chanting** facts; lower school uses **memorization**—weekly **poetry memorization**. ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][5]) ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][6])
- Upper School: “**focused class discussion**,” perform a **poem** and deliver a short **address** (rhetoric practice). ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][7])
- **Narration** and nature study in lower school (Charlotte Mason) aligned with classical formation of habits. ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][9])

**Keyword check vs. framework:** **Socratic**, **memorization/recitation/chanting**, **rhetoric/speeches**, formation habits; **wonder**/contemplation language present though the term **scholé** isn’t used. Positives align with the pedagogy list.

**Tally:** 8 positive vs 0 negative → **100% positive**
**Notes:** No evidence of project-based/skills-first pedagogy as the center.

---

# 5) Faculty → **CLASSICAL**

**School’s own words:**

- “Portrait of a Teacher”: teachers **model** love for what is **true, good, and beautiful**; **mentor** students; **lead by example**; are **lifelong learners**. ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][10])

**Keyword check vs. framework:** “teachers as **models of virtue**,” **mentorship & collegiality**—direct hits.

**Tally:** 6 positive vs 0 negative → **100% positive**
**Notes:** Language avoids “teacher-as-facilitator/skills-based” negatives.

---

# 6) Parents & Community → **CLASSICAL**

**School’s own words:**

- “the child’s learning falls under the **primary responsibility of parents**… the Academy… is a **partner** with a child’s parents.” ([Jackson Hole Classical Academy][11])
- Charlotte Mason page: “**Parents are the primary influence** in their children’s lives; this responsibility cannot be delegated elsewhere.” ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][9])
- Public **Parent Orientation** listed on events. ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][12])

**Keyword check vs. framework:** **Parent partnership/co-educators**—explicit positive.

**Tally:** 5 positive vs 0 negative → **100% positive**

## Notable strengths (with receipts)

- **Mission-level formation:** “wisdom and virtue,” “true, good, beautiful,” **Christian** telos. ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][1])
- **Classical structure:** **Trivium**, **Latin**, **Great Books/classics**, **poetry & memory**. ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][5])
- **Pedagogy that fits the tradition:** **Socratic method**; **chanting/memorization** in grammar stage; **rhetoric** performances. ([Jackson Hole Classical Academy][8])
- **Teachers as mentors/models:** Portrait page articulates **teacher-as-former-of-souls**. ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][10])
- **Parents as partners:** explicit **co-educator** language. ([Jackson Hole Classical Academy][11])

---

## Minor watch-outs (do not change rating)

- Occasional phrases like **“inquiry-based learning”**/**“hands-on”** appear in lower school science; ensure they’re subordinate to memory, narration, and nature study (as currently presented). ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][6])
- The **AP Biology** note (9th grade) is fine, but guard against drift toward an **AP-driven** identity (a negative if it displaces classical aims). ([jacksonholeclassicalacademy.org][7])
